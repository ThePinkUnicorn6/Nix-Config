> userChrome Themes work by Having the Browser read stylized `.css text files` in a certain directory within your Profile Folder. There are two easy ways to locate this folder:

1. Go to the `about:support` page
- In the URL Bar, type `about:support`.
- Look at the **Profile Folder** row. Open the folder.
- In that folder, create a new folder named `chrome` (If it doesnt already exist).

2. Go to the `about:profiles` page
- In the URL Bar, type `about:profiles`.
- Your profile will say `This is the profile in use and...`. Click the **Open Directory** button in the **Root Directory** row.
- In that folder, create a new folder named `chrome` (if it doesnt already exist).
